     * Send Document
     * 
     * RFC 2911 3.3.1:
     * This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to create a multi-document
     * Job object that is initially "empty" (contains no documents).  In the
     * Create-Job response, the Printer object returns the Job object's URI
     * (the "job-uri" attribute) and the Job object's 32-bit identifier (the
     * "job-id" attribute).  For each new document that the client desires
     * to add, the client uses a Send-Document operation.  Each Send-
     * Document Request contains the entire stream of document data for one
     * document.
     * 
     * If the Printer supports this operation but does not support multiple
     * documents per job, the Printer MUST reject subsequent Send-Document
     * operations supplied with data and return the 'server-error-multiple-
     * document-jobs-not-supported'.  However, the Printer MUST accept the
     * first document with a 'true' or 'false' value for the "last-document"
     * operation attribute (see below), so that clients MAY always submit
     * one document jobs with a 'false' value for "last-document" in the
     * first Send-Document and a 'true' for "last-document" in the second
     * Send-Document (with no data).
     * 
     * Since the Create-Job and the send operations (Send-Document or Send-
     * URI operations) that follow could occur over an arbitrarily long
     * period of time for a particular job, a client MUST send another send
     * operation within an IPP Printer defined minimum time interval after
     * the receipt of the previous request for the job.  If a Printer object
     * supports the Create-Job and Send-Document operations, the Printer
     * object MUST support the "multiple-operation-time-out" attribute (see
     * section 4.4.31).  This attribute indicates the minimum number of
     * seconds the Printer object will wait for the next send operation
     * before taking some recovery action.

     * Get Job Attributes
     * 
     * RFC 2911 3.3.4:
     * This REQUIRED operation allows a client to request the values of
     * attributes of a Job object and it is almost identical to the Get-
     * Printer-Attributes operation (see section 3.2.5).  The only
     * differences are that the operation is directed at a Job object rather
     * than a Printer object, there is no "document-format" operation
     * attribute used when querying a Job object, and the returned attribute
     * group is a set of Job object attributes rather than a set of Printer
     * object attributes.
     * 
     * For Jobs, the possible names of attribute groups are:
     * - 'job-template': the subset of the Job Template attributes that
     *   apply to a Job object (the first column of the table in Section
     *   4.2) that the implementation supports for Job objects.
     * - 'job-description': the subset of the Job Description attributes
     *   specified in Section 4.3 that the implementation supports for
     *   Job objects.
     * - 'all': the special group 'all' that includes all attributes that
     *   the implementation supports for Job objects.
     * 
     * Since a client MAY request specific attributes or named groups, there
     * is a potential that there is some overlap.  For example, if a client
     * requests, 'job-name' and 'job-description', the client is actually
     * requesting the "job-name" attribute once by naming it explicitly, and
     * once by inclusion in the 'job-description' group.  In such cases, the
     * Printer object NEED NOT return the attribute only once in the
     * response even if it is requested multiple times.  The client SHOULD
     * NOT request the same attribute in multiple ways.
     * 
     * It is NOT REQUIRED that a Job object support all attributes belonging
     * to a group (since some attributes are OPTIONAL).  However it is
     * REQUIRED that each Job object support all these group names.
